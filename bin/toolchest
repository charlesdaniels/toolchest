#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#
#  Utility for managing and installing toolchest, as well as toolchest packages.
#
#  The toolchest ships with a set of core utilities, kept in the bin/ folder
#  (the same directory as this file). These are scripts and utilities which
#  are used commonly enough by toolchest packages that they need to be present
#  always. They are usually bourne shell scripts, and should be portable
#  across any POSIX compliant system.
#
#  The toolchest also ships a set of optional packages, in the packages/
#  directory. These may be installed using `toolchest package install`.
#  Packages may or may not be fully portable, may have their own dependencies,
#  and may even involve compilation. Package install scripts should handle any
#  dependency resolution that is needed.
#
#  Core utilities and libraries are kept in bin/ and lib/ respectively,
#  relative to installation root. local/bin/ and local/lib/ relative to
#  project root hold symlinks to build artifacts from packages. Things in
#  local/ should not be version controlled, but should be re-producible by
#  script (on the same system).
#
#  NOTE ON MULTIPLE INSTALLS
#  =========================
#
#  While technically a supported configuration, it is probably not a good idea
#  to have multiple installs of toolchest (eg. a system and a local install).
#  This may make both installations difficult to manage. Multiple separate
#  users having local installations should not cause any problems however.
#
#  USAGE
#  =====
#
#    package list . . . . . . . . . . . . list available packages
#
#    package install [package]  . . . . . install [package]
#
#    package uninstall [package]  . . . . uninstall [package]
#
#    package update [package] . . . . . . uninstall, then install [package]
#
#    package description [package]  . . . display [package]'s description
#
#    package status [package] . . . . . . check to see if [package] is
#                                         installed
#
#    package list-installed . . . . . . . display a list of packages which
#                                         have been marked as installed to the
#                                         console.
#   repo [directive] [target] . . . . . . interact with the toolchest's 
#                                         repository management subsystem. 
#
#    info . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . display toolchest's configuration
#
#    version  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . display the toolchest's version
#
#    dir  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . display NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR
#                                         and exit
#
#    refresh  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . refresh the toolchest installation
#                                         by wiping local/ then re-installing
#                                         packages marked as installed. The
#                                         contents of local/config are
#                                         preserved.
#
#    setup  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . verifies that all needed folders in
#                                         the local/ directory tree exist -
#                                         any that do not are created. On
#                                         successful setup completion, the
#                                         empty file
#
#                                         $NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR/local/config/setup-done
#
#                                         is created. When the toolchest first
#                                         launches, if this file does not
#                                         exist, then the setup directive is
#                                         executed automatically.
#
#  INTERNAL USE COMMANDS
#  =====================
#
#  These commands are intended for use by expert users and/or as an API to
#  internal toolchest utilities. If you don't have a good understanding of how
#  the toolchest works, you probably should not use these.
#
#    internal package unconditional-install [package]
#
#      Installs [package] unconditionally - package is NOT marked as
#      installed, and installation state is not modified. Does not install or
#      check package dependencies.
#
#    internal package unconditional-uninstall [package]
#
#      Uninstalls [package] unconditionally - package is NOT marked as
#      uninstalled, and installation state is not modified.
#
#
#    internal package mark-uninstalled [package]
#
#      Unconditionally marks a package as not installed, regardless of pre
#      existing installation state.
#
#    internal package mark-installed [package]
#
#      Unconditionally marks a package as installed, reguardless of pre
#      existing installation state.
#
#    internal package get-repo [package]
#
#      Display the repository to which a package belongs to stdout.
#
#  PACKAGES
#  ========
#
#  Packages should reside in directories within packages/ relative to
#  installation root. Each directory must contain one of: makefile, Makefile,
#  install.sh. When `toolchest package install` is run, if a makefile is
#  present in the packages directory, then `make install` will be run.
#  Otherwise `install.sh` will be run. In either case, the calling shell first
#  cds to the top level directory of the package.
#
#  If install.sh is used, it will be passed "$@" which will include argv[3]
#  and on. Further, the following environment variables are guarnteed:
#
#    NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR . . . root of toolchest installation
#    PACKAGE_NAME . . . . . . . . . . the name of the package being installed
#    PACKAGE_PATH . . . . . . . . . . full path to the package's folder
#
#  The same environment variables are provided when a package is uninstalled.
#
#  If using makefiles, packages should also implement `make uninstall` for de-
#  installation. Packages using install.sh should also make available an
#  uninstall.sh for the same purpose. uninstall.sh and `make uninstall` are
#  called in the same way as their counterparts.
#
#    INSTALLATION STATE
#    ------------------
#
#    Package installation state is stored in the file
#    $NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR/local/config/packages.list . The path to this
#    file is stored in $PACKAGE_LIST. The package list is a list of package
#    names, one per line, which are currently installed. The contents of the
#    package list are interacted with inside this file by the functions:
#
#      check_package_installed
#
#      mark_package_installed
#
#      mark_package_uninstalled
#
#      dedupe_packages
#
#    The package list is not mean to be modified outside of the toolchest, as
#    the package install and uninstall directives handle the package
#    installation state themselves.
#
#    Package installer and uninstaller scripts should NOT interact with
#    package installation state.
#
#    External scripts or expert users that need to modify package installation
#    state should do so via the internal use commands:
#
#      internal package mark-installed
#
#      internal package mark-uninstalled
#
#    Note that the package install/uninstall directives assume that if the
#    installer/unstaller script(s) for a package return 0, then the
#    install/uninstall operation completed successfully, and assume that it
#    failed on a nonzero exit code. Installer and uninstaller scripts should
#    set their exit codes appropriately.
#
#    DEPENDANCY HANDLING
#    -------------------
#
#    Packages may optionally include a directory named ``dep``, which may
#    contain any, all, or none of the following files:
#
#    system . . . . . a list of commands, one per line, which if they are not
#                     present in $PATH, will cause the installer to fail.
#
#    toolchest  . . . a list of toolchest package, which if they are not
#                     installed, will be installed. Should any dependency
#                     installation fail, the installer will fail.
#
#    uname  . . . . . a list of OS unames, one per line. If at least one does
#                     match `uname` on the current system, the installer will
#                     fail.
#
#    remote . . . . . a list of remote files which need to be downloaded for
#                     the package to install. Each line contains the output
#                     file name and the URL of the file, separated by a single
#                     space. Either CuRL or Wget will be used to download the
#                     file, depending on which is available. The output file
#                     will be placed in a folder named "remote" under the
#                     package directory. Failure to download the dependency
#                     will NOT cause toolchest to abort the installation - you
#                     need to check for the presence of your dependencies.
#                     
#    perl . . . . . . a list of perl modules which need to be installed for the
#                     package to work. If any are not currently installed, the 
#                     package installer fails. The toolchest will not attempt 
#                     to install the module, as on many systems doing so
#                     requires root access.su
#
#    Note that both of these files need to end in a blank line to be parsed
#    correctly.
#
#
#  ENVIORNMENT VARIABLES
#  =====================
#
#    NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR . . . existing toolchest install directory.
#                                     This is the toolchest install that the
#                                     script will manage. This environment
#                                     variable is the supported method for
#                                     managing both a local and a system wide
#                                     installation on the same machine. If not
#                                     set, it will be extrapolated at runtime.
#                                     If only a system or only a local
#                                     installation exists, it will be used. If
#                                     both exist, the local install will be
#                                     preferred.
#
#
#
#  DYNAMIC DIRECTIVES
#  ==================
#
#  If a directive is issued which is not explicitly declared in this file, it
#  will be searched for within lib/directives and local/lib/directives, and
#  if found executed. Many directives documented in this header are implemented
#  as dynamic directives, including "package" and "repo". Note that in some 
#  cases, such as an embedded distributions, directives may be omitted to 
#  save space if functionality is not required. For example, a toolchest install
#  which is used as a runtime likely does not require package or repository 
#  management to be enabled. 
#
#  Dynamic directives must be marked executeable, should have the extension
#  ".directive". 
#
#  AUTHOR'S NOTE ON STOW
#  =====================
#
#  Typically, stow would make a lot of sense to use for a project with as much
#  symlinking going on as toolchest. However, in my experience GNU stow is not
#  widely available on many systems. It is not present in the base
#  installation of macOS, nor in the base installation of FreeBSD 11 or Ubuntu
#  16. By removing stow as a dependency, the toolchest should be able to run
#  on a wide variety of systems without needing either root access (to use
#  the package manager) or fooling around with compiling stow from source.
#
#  As someone who has used stow fairly extensively, I very much respect stow
#  and it's capabilities, but sadly re-inventing the wheel in this respect is
#  a design decision I have made to improve portability.
