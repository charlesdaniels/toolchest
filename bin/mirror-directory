#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  This script produces an exact mirror of a particular directory, including
#  symbolic links, on another directory. This is useful, because  the
#  conventions for making ``cp`` preserve symlinks are not consistent across
#  all systems. 
#  
#  The method used was sourced from here:
#     
#     http://superuser.com/questions/138587/how-to-copy-symbolic-%20%20%20%20%20%20links/138604#138604
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#  $1 . . . . source directory
#  
#  $2 . . . . destination directory
#  
#  $3 . . . . (optional) if equal to "progress", show progress (requires pv)
