#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  Determines the location of the toolchest installation this script is running
#  from and exports it. 
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#  $1 . . . (optional) directive
#  
#  If a directive is specified, the following are recognized:
#  
#    dironly . . . . display the value of NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR on stdout
#                    then exit
#                    
#    export  . . . . produces the legacy behavior of acquire-toolchest-dirs,
#                    that is producing a series of export statements suitable
#                    for use in sh and similar languages via 
#                    $(acquire-toolchest-dirs export)
#
#  If no directive is specified, the following behavior is used (for backwards
#  compatibility with pre-0.0.5 conventions) - this will likely be deprecated
#  eventually, so this convention should not be used in new scripts.
# 
#    This script outputs some commands you should run to populate a variety of
#    useful variable (enumerated below), to do this, run 
#    $(acquire-toolchest-dirs)
#  
#  
#  The following variables are defined in directives like "export" which emit
#  executable code, except as otherwise noted:
#  
#  NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR  . . . toolchest install dir
#  NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_LOCAL  . . `local/` dir inside of toolchest install
#  NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_BIN  . . . coreutils bin directory
#  NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_LIB  . . . coreutils lib directory
#  NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_PACKAGES . packages directory
#
