#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  This library serves to wrap a few simple, useful logging-related tools and
#  functionalities. It utilizes Python's built in `logging` module, as well as
#  `pprint`. This module has no external dependencies, and should work in
#  Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x.
#  
#  LOG FORMAT
#  ==========
#  
#  This module is hard-coded to use the following log format::
#    
#    <[ timestamp | caller | loglevel | message ]>
#    
#  An example log message follows::
#    
#    TODO
#    
#  TABLE OF METHOD SIGNATURES

#  setup(logPath, fileLevel, consoleLevel)
#  logWithExplicitLevel(msg, level)
#  prettyLog(obj, level="DEBUG", msg='')

# 
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  This method is used to set up Python's `logging` module. 
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#    
#    logPath  . . . absolute or relative path to log file (defaults to
#                   ./$0.log)
#    
#    fileLevel  . . lowest log level which will go to the log file (defaults
#                   to DEBUG)
#    
#    consoleLevel . the lowest log level which will go to the console
#                   (defaults to INFO)
#    
def setup(logPath="./"+sys.argv[0]+".log",

    fileHandler.setLevel(fileLevel)
    rootLogger.addHandler(fileHandler)

    consoleHandler = logging.StreamHandler()
    consoleHandler.setFormatter(logFormatter)

    consoleHandler.setLevel(consoleLevel)
    rootLogger.addHandler(consoleHandler)

#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  Logs a string using the python logging module, with the log level passed 
#  explicitly as an argument. Useful when loglevel is generated programatially. 
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#    msg . . . the message to log
#    
#    level . . the log level to use (as a string)
#  
def logWithExplicitLevel(msg, level):


    logLevels = {"DEBUG":     10,
                 "INFO":      20,
                 "WARNING":   30,
                 "ERROR:":    40,
                 "CRITICAL":  50}

    if level not in logLevels.keys():
        try:
            # maybe somebody passed us an integer log level directly
            level = int(level)
        except ValueError:
            # nope, this was not an integer log level
            logging.error("failed to log  message with level '{}': \n{}"
                          .format(level, msg))
    else:
        # the level is for a loglevel we know about
        level = logLevels[level]

    assert isinstance(level, int) # level should always be an int by this point
    # actually do the logging part
    logging.log(level, msg)

#  
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  Logs an object to the console, but runs it through pprint first (via
#  pformat). This is handy when you want to log large data structures that can
#  be unreadable when using __repr__ or __str__
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#    obj . . . . the object to log (must be supported by pprint.pformat) -
#                this is NOT checked
#                
#    level . . . log level to log the object with (defaults to  "DEBUG")
#    
#    msg   . . . optional message to prepend to the object's pretty
#                representation
def prettyLog(obj, level="DEBUG", msg=''):
    prettyStr = pprint.pformat(obj)  # prettify the object
    prettyStr = msg + prettyStr
    logWithExplicitLevel(prettyStr, level)  # now perform the logging
