From the upstream site:

If you have a file called todo.txt on your computer right now, you're in the
right place.

So many power users try dozens of complicated todo list software applications,
only to go right back to their trusty todo.txt file.

But it's not easy to open todo.txt, make a change, and save itâ€”especially on
your touchscreen device and at the command line. Todo.txt apps solve that
problem.

Simplicity is todo.txt's core value.

You're not going to find many checkboxes, drop-downs, reminders, or date
pickers here.

Todo.txt apps are minimal, todo.txt-focused editors which help you manage your
tasks with as few keystrokes and taps possible.
