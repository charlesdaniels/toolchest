A command line, stack-based calculator with postfix notation that displays the
stack contents at all times. As you type, the stack changes are reflected
immediately.

In a stack-based postfix calculator, entering a number pushes it on a stack, and
arithmetic operations pop their arguments from the stack and push the result. As
all the operations take a fix number of arguments, there's no room for
ambiguity: parenthesis and operator precedence are not needed. Postfix notation
is also known as reverse Polish notation, or RPN.
