upstream:

texfot invokes texcmd with the given texarg arguments, filtering the online
output for ‘‘interesting’’ messages. Its exit value is that of texcmd.
Examples:

        # Sample basic invocation:
        texfot pdflatex file.tex
        # Ordinarily all output is copied to /tmp/fot before filtering;
        # that can be omitted:
        texfot pdflatex −−tee=/dev/null file.tex
        # Example of more complex engine invocation:
        texfot lualatex −−recorder '\nonstopmode\input file'

Aside from its own options, described below, texfot just runs the given
command with the given arguments (same approach to command line syntax as env,
nice, time, timeout, etc.). Thus, texfot works with any engine and any command
line options.

texfot does not look at the log file or any other possible output file(s); it
only looks at the standard output and standard error from the command. stdout
is processed first, then stderr. Lines from stderr have an identifying prefix.
texfot writes all accepted lines to its stdout.

The messages shown are intended to be those which likely need action by the
author: error messages, overfull and underfull boxes, undefined citations,
missing characters from fonts, etc.
