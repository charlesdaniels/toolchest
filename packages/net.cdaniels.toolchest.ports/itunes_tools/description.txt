  Introduction
  ============

    These tools, written to be used with iTunes on Mac OS X, serve three
    purposes:

    * using iTunes as a GUI to select music files (itunes_selection).

    * creating new playlists in iTunes (make_itunes_playlist and
      build_itunes_playlists).

    * adding files to the iTunes library while avoiding the creation of
      duplicate entries (itunes_add_missing).

  Requirements
  ============

    Once compiled, the binaries should work on OS X 10.4 and later, when using
    a 32-bit Intel processor. However, I have only tested them on a 64-bit
    10.7 system. The source compiles with Xcode 4.3, but it may also work with
    earlier versions.

  Installation
  ============

    Running the install.sh script will compile the source using Xcode, and
    install the binaries in /usr/local/bin, and the man pages (where existent)
    in /usr/local/share/man.

  Usage
  =====

    itunes_selection
    ----------------

      Select tracks in the main window of iTunes and run

        itunes_selection

      to get a newline-separated list of the paths to the selected tracks,
      similar to the output of find.

    make_itunes_playlist
    --------------------

      Running
  
        make_itunes_playlist "My Playlist" file1 file2 file3
  
      will create a new playlist in iTunes, titled "My Playlist (timestamp)",
      containing file1, file2 and file3 as its tracks. Alternatively, you can
      use - as an argument to read a list of paths from stdin:
  
        find foo/ -iname "*.mp3" | make_itunes_playlist "My Playlist" -
      
    build_itunes_playlists
    ----------------------

      Suppose you have a folder foo/, containing an m3u playlist list.m3u, and
      a subfolder foo/bar/ containing another playlist another\ list.m3u. Then
      running

        build_itunes_playlists foo

      will created a new folder playlist titled "Imported (timestamp)" in
      iTunes, containg a playlist "list" containing the tracks in list.m3u,
      and a subfolder "bar" containing "another list".

    itunes_add_missing
    ------------------

      Suppose you have a folder foo/ containing lots of MP3 files, some of
      which are already in the iTunes library, but some of which are not. Use
      the following command to add only those files which are missing from the
      iTunes library to it:

        find foo/ -iname "*.mp3" | itunes_add_missing

      Note that itunes_add_missing is a little slow to start because it
      collects the inodes of all file tracks in your iTunes library when you
      run it. It does not check for doubles in its input.

  Silly example
  =============

    Select some file tracks in iTunes and run

      itunes_selection | make_itunes_playlist "Don't need no plus button" -

    to make a playlist out of them without using the "+" button in the lower
    left of the screen.
