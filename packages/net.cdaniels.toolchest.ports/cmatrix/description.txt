        CMatrix is a program I wrote one evening because I didn't want to have
        to run Wind*ws to see the cool scrolling lines from 'The Matrix', my
        fave movie.  If you haven't seen this movie and you are a fan of
        computers or sci-fi in general, go see this movie!!!  I have seen it
        twice, and I'm pondering seeing it again before it comes out on VHS.

        Cmatrix is written in ncurses under Linux, and should compile on other
        OSes with few modifications.  I  am always interested to hear from
        people who use this program and any modifications they make to it!

        CMatrix is distributed via the GNU GPL, please see the COPYING file or
        the GNU Project homepage  for more information.
