#
# OVERVIEW
# ========
#
# As of Toolchets release 1.1.1, this script is a wrapper for latexrun. For
# backards-compatibility, this script still responds correctly to the
# -r option, and the -b option is silently ignored.
#
# USAGE
# =====
#
#   -r,--recursive . . . . Operate on *.tex, recurse into subdirectories, and
#                          operate in *.tex in those as well.
#
#   -b,--bibtex  . . . . . Depricated - kept but ignored silently for
#                          backwards compatibility.
