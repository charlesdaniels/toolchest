#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  Accepts one or more MAC addresses on standard input, formats them to be
#  lower case and colon-delimited. Characters which are not valid hexadecimal
#  characters will be discarded. Each converted input is displayed on it's own
#  line on standard out. Error checking is not done - if you put invalid MACs
#  in, you will get invalid MACs back out.
