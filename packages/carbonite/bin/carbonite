#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
# 
#  Wrapper script for invoking the carbonite tool. For help, pass --help in $@. 
#  
#  Carbonite is a tool for packing one or more scripts (or binaries, although
#  this is discouraged) into a single monolithic executable. This can be
#  useful in cases where, for example, one has a script with several
#  dependencies or libraries which it depends on, and one wishes to run this
#  script say over ssh, on a remote system which does not have the requisite
#  dependencies. Carbonite can also be useful for cases where one wishes to
#  redistribute a program and all it's dependancies to a user that will not
#  need to modify the sources for the program (note that carbonite executables
#  do not resist being disassembled or inspected - in fact carbonite includes
#  a switch for doing just this).
#  
#  Carbonite works by first creating a tar archive of the payload and any
#  other files which have been marked for inclusion. This tar archive is then
#  encoded using base64, and paced into a simple text based format, which is
#  then appended to the extract-execute.lib stub, which is able to parse the
#  tar archive back out of itself.
#  
#  DEPENDANCIES
#  ============
#  
#  Carbonite standalone executables have a few basic dependencies, besides any
#  the payload may introduce:
#  
#  * sed
#  * base64
#  * date
#  * tar
#  
#  Additionally, a few assumptions are made about the system which the
#  executable will run on:
#  
#  * /tmp exists, is writable, and is non-empty
#  * /bin/sh is POSIX compliant 
#  * the command referred to by `tar` understands how to extract .tar,
#    .tar.gz, and .tar.xz when used with the `xf` option.
