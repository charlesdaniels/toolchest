# OVERVIEW
# ========
#
# This script parses an m3u format playlist file, identifies the file on the
# current filesystem for each file in the playlist, then copies the file
# without re-encoding it into the output directory in a structure which
# mirrors that of the original media library. This is useful for large media
# libraries where only a small fraction of all media is used in a playlist at
# a given time. This script can also be used in conjunction with audioutil-
# publish to produce small libraries containing only the songs needed for a
# small set of playlist(s).
#
# This script also copies the input .m3u file into the output in the same
# location relative to the library root.
#
#
# USAGE
# =====
#
#   $1 . . . input playlist
#   $2 . . . output directory
