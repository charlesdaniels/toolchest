# OVERVIEW
# ========
# 
# This script updates all files in a given .m3u file to have the same extension.
# This is useful when used in conjunction with audioutil-recode for batch
# processing. It is used by audioutil-publish to repair broken references in 
# m3u files. 
# 
# Note that this script modifies the file in place. Further, GNU sed must be 
# available in a way that will be detected by ``sensible-sed``.
# 
# USAGE
# =====
# 
#   $1 . . . file to repair
#   $2 . . . new extensions foe media files
