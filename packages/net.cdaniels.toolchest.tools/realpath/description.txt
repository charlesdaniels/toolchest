Because the realpath command is not available on every system, the toolchest
ships with it's own implementation in pure sh (actually, it is Michael Kropat's
implementation, graciously licensed under the MIT license).

By default this implementation is only available within the toolchest itself.
This package exposes this functionality as a shell script, which is useful when
you have other, non-toolchest scripts that need realpath.

If you are using a UNIX that ships realpath out of the box, or where it is
available as a package, you should not use this!
