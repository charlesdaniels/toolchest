#
# SYNOPSIS
# ========
#
# This script will remove all GnuPlot build artifacts recursively relative to.
#
# ATTENTION: this script will recursively remove files without prompting,
# make sure you understand what this script does before you run it!
#
# For the recursively-selected set of all files ending in '.gp', the basename
# of each file cat-ed with the following file extensions will be deleted:
#
#	* .png
#	* .jpg
#	* .eps
#	* .ps
#	* .plt
#	* .plot
#	* .out
#
# For example, if run in a directory which contained 'foo.gp' and 'foo.png',
# this script would delete 'foo.png'.
