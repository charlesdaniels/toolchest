#
# SYNOPSIS
# ========
#
# This script will do it's best to rebuild all GnuPlot and LaTeX documents
# below . recursively, according to my conventions. This calls all of the other
# texutil scripts in recursive mode - you should read *all* of them, as several
# can delete your files without asking first, which could result in data loss
# if you don't follow the conventions used in texutil rigidly.
#
# DOCUMENTATION
# =============
#
# Conventions are as follows:
#
#	* Only top-level documents end in .tex - this extensions implies a PDF
#	  of the same basename should be generated.
#
#	* All documents ending in .gp are GnuPlot files that should be run, and
#	  any files sharing the same basename but with a set of extensions
#	  defined in texutil-cleangp should be deleted after compilation.
#
#	* All documents ending in .tex should have related build artifacts,
#	  except for generated PDFs purged every compile. What constitutes
#	  related build artifacts is defined in texutil-cleanup, but generally
#	  includes .aux files, logs, and so on.
#
# The idea of this script, and the related scripts in the texutil package, is
# that you can run them at the top level directory of your documents/school/
# project/whatever folder, and an appropriate PDF will be produced for every
# file therein, en-mass. Where this can trip is is cases where you need to
# insert *special sauce* into your LaTeX build process - there is nothing
# implemented yet to handle these cases, but it will probably take the form of
# adding something like .texutil-ignore as a file to a directory to make
# texutil ignore it.
