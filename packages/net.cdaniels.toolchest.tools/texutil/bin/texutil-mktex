#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
# 
#  This script will attempt to compile a given .tex file using pdflatex. 
#  
#  Multiple .tex file may be specified for compilation. 
#  
#  If $1 is '-r', then texutil-mktex will instead recurse into directories,
#  including ./, and attempt to compile *.tex there.
#  
#  This script will by default run pdflatex such that it will not pause on
#  errors. Further, this script will always exit with an exit code of 0, even
#  if one or more compilations failed.
#  
#  Further, this script will utilize texfot to display only
#  pertinent/important error messages.
#  
#  CONFIGURATION
#  =============
#  
#  This script may be configured via the file
#  $NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_LOCAL/config/texutil-mktex.cfg
#  
#  The following keys are recognized: 
#  
#    PDFLATEX_COMMAND . . . command which invokes `pdflatex`; defaults to
#                           `pdflatex` if not specified
#                           
#    PDFLATEX_OPTS  . . . . options to pass to pdflatex; defaults to
#                           `-interaction=nonstopmode` if not specified
