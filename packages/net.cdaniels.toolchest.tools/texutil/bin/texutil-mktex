#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
# 
#  This script will attempt to compile a given .tex file using pdflatex. 
#  
#  Multiple .tex file may be specified for compilation. 
#  
#  If $1 is '-r', then texutil-mktex will instead recurse into directories,
#  including ./, and attempt to compile *.tex there.
#  
#  This script will always run pdflatex such that it will not pause on errors.
#  Further, this script will always exit with an exit code of 0, even if one
#  or more compilations failed.
#  
#  CONFIGURATION
#  =============
#  
#  This script may be configured via the file
#  $NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_LOCAL/config/texutil-mktex.cfg
#
