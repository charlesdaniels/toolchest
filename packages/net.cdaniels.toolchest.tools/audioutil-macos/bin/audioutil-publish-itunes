# OVERVIEW
# ========
# 
# This script calls audioutil-publish, then invokes audioutil-itunes-import on
# the output thereof. Note that $2 of audioutil-publish ($3 for this script), 
# is used as a temporary directory to store the re-encoded music library, and
# is deleted after this script finishes.
# 
# !!! WARNING !!!
# 
# This script will DELETE all existing iTunes data each time it is executed.
# Any changes you have made in iTunes to playlists, media files, and so on, as
# well as any music files which exist only in iTunes will be PERMENANTLY
# DESTROYED.
# 
# USAGE
# =====
# 
# $1 . . . location of iTunes library (usually ~/Music/iTunes)
# 
# $@ . . . passed on to audioutil-publish
