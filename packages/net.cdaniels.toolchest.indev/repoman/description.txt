A tool for managing toolchest repositories installed from remote sources such
as git. Currently in development. This package is pre-alpha quality and will
probably break your stuff, it is also not feature complete. 

When this package is complete it will be moved to coreutils - this will likely
be the main feature of the 1.1.0 release.
