This package attempts to fully abstract the system's package manager away from
the user. This means, for the moast part, one can run pkg-install on any
supported system and have the desired package be installed. This is not always
flawless -not all operations are always supported on all systems, but it's
usually pretty good, and makes it easier to build muscle memory when working
on many different systems.
