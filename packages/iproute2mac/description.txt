Installs iproute2mac from github. Will fail to install on non-macOS systems. 

From the iproute2mac github page:

  CLI wrapper for basic network utilities on Mac OS X inspired with iproute2
  on Linux systems - ip command.
  
  Provided functionality is limited and command output is not fully compatible
  with iproute2.
  
  Goal of this project is to make basic network configuration/debug tasks on
  Mac OS X easy for admins who already use Linux   systems.
  
  For advanced usage use netstat, ifconfig, ndp, arp, route and networksetup
  directly.
