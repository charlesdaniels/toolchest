0.0.2-ALPHA:

  2016-12-12 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed an issue affecting FreeBSD11 (and probably other BSD systems)
      where $0/../.. would error because $0 was a file, not a directory.
      This expansion is legal in many sh implementations (including macOS
      10.12), but failed on FreeBSD 11.

      This was fixed by removing the `toolchest` from the end of `realpath
      $0` using sed and working relative to that, as the parent of a file
      should always be a directory.

0.0.3-ALPHA:

  2016-12-12 - Charles Daniels:

    * Installer now uses tar in a rather novel way to copy directories while
      preserving symlinks. This fixes an issue where the installer would
      copy links to generic-installer and generic-uninstaller as if they
      were files with the actual contents of the relevant libraries.

      This method was chosen instead of cp --preserve=links because BSD-
      style systems (tested: macOS 10.12, FreeBSD 11) do not support this
      syntax for cp.

    * Added additional progress messages to installer

    * Added random-uuid to universal-tools package

  2016-12-13 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed a bug in acquire-toolchest-dirs which caused it to incorrectly
      identify NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR

    * Added check-command-exists library to coreutils libraries

    * universal-tools now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies

    * archiveutils now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies

  2016-12-16 - Charles Daniels

    * renamed the mac-shortcuts package to macosutils to better reflect purpose

    * renamed cleardns to macosutils-cleardns

    * added an alternate method of DNS cache flushing to macosutils-cleardns

    * macosutils-cleardns no longer kills mDNSResponder as root - this may
      reduce it's effectiveness when running as non-root users

    * renamed unquarintine to macosutils-unquarantine

    * added macosutils-fixwifi script to troubleshoot common end-user network
      problems

  2016-12-16 - Charles Daniels

    * added package to install m-cli

0.0.4-ALPHA:

  2016-12-19 - Charles Daniels:

    * Wrote the carbonite 0.0.1 file format specification

  2016-12-20 - Charles Daniels:

    carbonite:

      - argument parsing

      - logging (via loggingutils)

    * added the net.cdaniels.python package with lib/loggingutils.py package

    * added `dir` directive to `toolchest`

  2016-12-21 - Charles Daniels:

    net.cdaniels.toolchest.coreutils:

      sensible-python3

        * add support for Python 3.6

        * add support for Python 3.7

    carbonite:

      * payload and include validation

      * checksum generation

      * archive generation

      * can produce valid output via --archive_only

      * installer (via Makefile)

      * sh wrapper

      * payload extract-execute script

      * carbonite standalone executable generation

0.0.5-ALPHA

  2016-12-21 - Charles Daniels:

    * implemented function to check if packages are installed, and to mark
      them installed or uninstalled.

      * still need to make the package install/uninstall directives interface
        with the new functions.

      * implemented "toolchest package mark-installed"

      * implemented "toolchest package mark-uninstalled"

  2016-12-22 - Charles Daniels:

    * add iproute2mac package

    * toolchest management utility now correctly interacts with installation
      status. For example, it will refuse to install a package which is
      already installed.

    * implemented "toolchest package list-installed"

    * "toolchest package mark-[un]installed" now refuses to work on
      nonexistent packages

    pdfutils:

      * add support for PDFPen

      * fixed a bug where paths containing spaces would result in invoke-*-ocr
        being called on a garbage path.

      * installer now warns if no supported OCR software is detected

    * toolchest management utility now has internal functions to perform
      unconditional package installations and uninstallations.

    * toolchest now has an "internal" directive for internal use commands

    * implemented internal use commands:

      * internal package unconditional-install

      * internal package unconditional-uninstall

      * internal package mark-installed

      * internal package mark-uninstalled

    * removed package mark-installed and mark-uninstalled, as these were
      intended to be internal use only from the getgo (the same functionality
      is now provided by the internal commands above).

    * implemented `toolchest refresh` to refresh toolchest installation,
      preserving only configuration and installed package listing.

    * toolchest package list-installed now displays an error message when the
      package list has not yet been initialized.

  2016-12-24 - Charles Daniels:

    * added package for tcc c compiler

  2016-12-26 - Charles Daniels:

    * added user's manual

    * added packaging guide

  2016-12-30 - Charles Daniels:

    * added normalize-path implementation in...

      * Python

      * pure SH

      * BASH + readlink

    * added normalize-path to net.cdaniels.coreutils as a binary in $PATH, to
      provide cross-platform path normalization - it should be used to replace
      realpath in all scripts from here out.

  2016-12-31 - Charles Daniels:

    * acquire-toolchest-dirs now backed by `toolchest dir`

    * documented conventions for acquiring toolchest install dir

    * added directives to ``acquire-toolchest-dirs``, implemented...

      * export - produces legacy functionality

      * dironly - identical behaviour to ``toolchest dir``, intended as a
        stable API to provide this functionality for scripts

    * replaced normalize-path with Michael Kropat's sh implementation from
      GitHub. normalize-path is still left as a coreutils binary for
      convienience, but it simply wraps the new lib/realpath.lib

  2017-01-01 - Charles Daniels:

    * added mirror-directory command to coreutils

    * added dependency resolution - see toolchest header for docs

    * T376 now causes ``toolchest`` to exit directly with an exit code of 1

  2017-01-03 - Charles Daniels:

    * toolchest now supports running from anywhere on the system

    * ``toolchest install`` and ``toolchest uninstall`` have been removed -
      see updated user manual for documentation on the new install procedure.

    * removed warning ``T176`` and related checks

    * added ``toolchest setup`` to set up ``local``

    * check_command_exists from check-command-exists.lib no longer declared
      with the function keyword for compatibility with BSD

    * preinstall script for universal-tools now ises . instead of soirce for
      BSD compatibility

  2017-01-07 - Charles Daniels:

    * fixed bug affecting systems with sh being BASH 3.X (and probably others)
      ``realpath`` re-implementation in the management utility was not
      detected correctly, resulting in bogus values for
      $NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR - while ugly, the selected solution was to
      simply move it to the top of the file.

      This issue was found to affect Mac OSX 10.5.8, and may have affected
      other systems with old versions of BASH.

    * added logic to ``toolchest setup`` to symlink normalize-path to
      realpath is realpath is not found on the system

      NOTE: this check does not seem reliable on OSX 10.5.8... further
      investigation is needed.

  2017-01-08 - Charles Daniels:

    * added youtube-dl package

  2017-01-09 - Charles Daniels:

    * added generate-monatomic-strseq to archiveutils

      sometimes attempt to shift an argument that did not exist.

    * removed a redundant source command from pkg-search

  2017-01-11 - Charles Daniels:

    * removed some dead code from pkg-install

    * fixed system-statusline so it fails more gracefully whe nsome of the
      commands it depends on are not present

    * system-statusline now supports amixer for detecting volume level

  2017-01-14 - Charles Daniels:

    * added package for pamixer (debian does not package pamixer)

    * added package for Linux version of sublime text 3 (Debian does not
      package it either)

    * added support for checking OS uname as a package dependency

  2017-01-15 - Charles Daniels:

    * considerable improvements to burn in universal-utils

      * remove dependency on "wc"

      * remove dependency on "pv", although it is still used if present

      * can now run itself as root by passing "asroot" on $3

  2017-01-16 - Charles Daniels:

    * improved makefile for pamixer - library dependencies are now checked via
      ldconfig

      * possible regression: it is not yet clear whether this approach will be
        portable to *BSD, which can also use pulseaudio in some circumstances.
        This should be tested.

    * systemutils.system-statusline - fixed a bug where MUTE state was not
      detected correctly due to `==` rater than `=` in an if statement.

      * MEMO: it has come to my attention that the correct operator for string
        comparison in POSIX sh is `=`, not `==`.

  2017-01-17 - Charles Daniels:

    * fixed issue where preinstall script for archiveutils used `source`
      instead of `.`

    * remove preinstall script from archiveutils in favor of using toolchest's
      built in dependency resolution.

    * `toolchest setup` now symlinks md5sum to md5 if the former is present in
      $PATH but the latter is not.

  2017-01-19 - Charles Daniels:

    * generic-install now also links files in lib/

    * added zsh-autosuggestions port

  2017-01-20 - Charles Daniels:

    * added port for zsh-syntax-highlighting

  2017-01-30 - Charles Daniels:

    * Added dependencies to sytsemutils as planned in the ROADMAP.

    * Added dependencies to todotxt-extensions, as planned in the ROADMAP.

      * I am not aware of a good way to validate that the system's ``sed`` is
        GNU sed.

    * system-statusline now gracefully degrades when running on kernels
      without procfs, or systems without ``sensors``, etc.

      * Possible new bug: IP address is not detected correctly on Darwin
        systems (using the ``ip`` router from ``iproute2mac``).

    * mirror-directory will now show progress using ``pv``, if ``pv`` is
      present on the system, and if ``$3`` is ``progress``.

    * added a new script, toolchest-doc, which extracts the documentation
      headers from toolchest files.

1.0.0:

  2017-01-31 - Charles Daniels:

    * Implemented toolchest internal package get-repo, and backing function in
      the toolchest

    * Updated generic-*install.sh to handle repos correctly.

    * toolchest package list is now compatible with repos

    * Updated the following packages to work with repos:

      * pkgutils
      * universal-tools
      * m-cli
      * mars4
      * pdfutils
      * example
      * helloworld
      * todo.txt
      * texutil
      * archiveutils
      * carbonite
      * iproute2mac
      * lprutils
      * macosutils
      * systemutils
      * tcc
      * template
      * todotxt-extensions
      * zsh-autosuggestions
      * zsh-syntax-highlighting

    * Fixed a bug in system-statusline where presences of the `sensors` command
      was not detected correctly.

1.0.1:

  2017-02-01 - Charles Daniels:

    * generate-separator moved from coreutils to
      net.cdaniels.toolchest.pycoreutils, as it depends on Python.

    * download moved from universal-tools to coreutils

    * download can now accept output file name on $2

    * added ability to fetch "remote" dependancies to ``package install``.

    * FIXED: issue #1 - toolchest package list now works on Linux systems

      * the fix involves using find -mindepth and -maxdepth, however it is not
        clear to me if these options can safely be assumed to exist on all
        POSIX systems. It would seem that OSX, Linux, and *BSD generally support
        these options however.

    * migrate sublime-text-3-linux to repos package style

    * toolchest package install and uninstall now supports arbitrary number of
      targets (i.e. ``toolchest package install foo bar baz`` is now legal)

    * added port for pv

  2017-02-03 - Charles Daniels:

    * Improved reliability of check-command-exists.lib

    * Added wrapper for check-command-exists to coreutils

    * Added pdf-from-office script to pdfutils

1.0.2:

  2017-02-18 - Charles Daniels:

    * add cmatrix port

  2017-02-24 - Charles Daniels:

    * archive-create now create .gz files, rather than .xz

  2017-02-25 - Charles Daniels:

    * fixed a bug in texutil-cleanup where multiple files ending in -blx.bib
      would cause the script to crash.

    * add net.cdaniels.toolchest.uofsc package repo for UofSC related scripts

    * add CSCE212 package to uofsc package repo for CSCE212 related utilities

    * added itunes_tools port

    * added audioutil-macos package

      * audioutil-itunes-import

      * audioutil-publish-itunes

    * modified audioutil-recode to check for the environment variable
      AUDIOUTIL_RECODE_NOVERWRITE, if it is "YES", and the output file
      already exists, then the script exists silently.

    * $NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_LOCAL/cache is now a part of the standard
      installation.

  2017-03-03 - Charles Daniels:

    * `toolchest dir` no longer has a newline after output

      * this does not break acquire-toolchest-dirs, so scripts using that
        are unaffected.

    * added texfot port

    * texutil:

      * texutil-mktex rewritten in perl

      * texutil-mktex now uses texfot to provide more useful output

      * fixed bug #1 (texutil-mktex now correctly handles multiple input files
        on argv, and multiple input files which include spaces)

      * perl is now a dependancy of texutil

      * texfot port is now a dependency of texutil

  2017-03-04 - Charles Daniels:

    * added audioutil-extract-playlist

    * toolchest now supports dependency checking for perl modules

  2017-03-09 - Charles Daniels:

    * toolchest now checks if /bin/sh does not support `local`, if not,
      it will attempt to run through a supported shell. Should this fail, it
      will crash itself.

    * toolchest now supports OpenIndiana 5.11 - this should bring support for
      any other UNIX which uses ksh93 or similar as /bin/sh also.

    * fixed the behavior of check-command-exists on OpenIndiana 5.11

    * tcc's Makefile now uses check-command-exists, rather than command  -v

    * acquire-toolchest-dirs will now attempt to make an educated guess about
      the toolchest's location if it is not in $PATH

    * ERROR T196 is now WARN T196 and is now written to stderr

    * added toolchest-genpath to net.cdaniels.toolchest.coreutils

    * added clean-mac script to net.cdaniels.toolchest.tools

  2017-03-15 - Charles Daniels:

    * texutil-mktex now supports advanced argument parsing

    * added --bibtex and --biber to texutil-mktex to invoke biber or bibtex
      during compilation.

    * texutil-mktex now enables shell escape by default

    * added 215utils-normalbash

  2017-03-20 - Charles Daniels:

    * moved code-tools from net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy to
      net.cdaniels.toolchest.tools, as it still works just fine.

  2017-03-21 - Charles Daniels:

    * added the pageget script to universal-tools

  2017-03-22 - Charles Daniels:

    * rewrote `toolchest package list` so it no longer depends on find, and
      works as expected when repos or packages are symlinks.

    * `repoman` is now feature-complete, and is now considered "beta" quality,
      it will be moved to coreutils as stability and correctness are verified
      in testing.

1.0.4:

  2017-03-30 - Charles Daniels:

    * Added archive-mkdmg script for producing .dmg files on macOS systems.

  2017-04-03 - Charles Daniels

  2017-04-08 - Charles Daniels:

    * universal-tools now uses the standard dependancy handling mechanism

    * universal-tools no longer requires wget (it is now an optional
      depenancy - some tools still don't work without it)

    * universal-tools now works out-of-box on stock Mac OSX 10.5.8

  2017-04-11 - Charles Daniels:

    * Updated `sysenv` to include additional information in reports.

  2017-04-14 - Charles Daniels:

    * Added net.cdaniels.ports.clac

  2017-04-21 - Charles Daniels:

    * added audioutil-flac2alac

    * ytrip no longer re-encodes downloaded tracks

  2017-04-24 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed a minor bug in sysenv where some outputs went to stderr instead of
      stdout


  2017-05-01 - Charles Daniels:

     * Fixed a bug in texutil-cleanup where it would miss the write18 test file
      if the .tex file being used for input contained spaces.

    * Created a package for toolchest-doctor and placed a stub in it.


1.1.0:

  2017-05-04 - Charles Daniels:

  * Depricated net.cdaniels.toolchest.indev/repoman

  * repoman is now a core utility and is accessible only as a directive

  * Broke utility functions for working with packages out to
    lib/toolchest-package.lib

  * Moved functionality required for "toolchest package" directive into a
    new coreutils binary: toolchest-package

  * Toolchest now runs the requested directive even if setup has not been
    completed yet (setup will still run on the first run)

  * Implemented support for dynamic directives

  * "package" is now a dynamic directive

  * "repo" is now a dynamic directive

  * "setup" is now a dynamic directive

  * added package.cfg (optional) file to package directories, which may
    specfiy an installer or uninstaller script relative to the toolchest
    directory. The primary use case here is to avoid using symlinks for
    packages in external repositories managed by toolchest repo.

    This documented in lib/toolchest-package.lib

  * to demonstrate the above, macosutils now specifies it's installer and
    uninstaller via package.cfg.

  * fixed a minor bug in generic-uninstall where it failed to correctly clean
    up the packages' library directories.


  2017-05-05 - Charles Daniels:

    * "internal" is now a dynamic directive

    * youtube-dl has been tested and moved to the ports repo

    * the following packages have been deprecated:

      * net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy/240utils

      * net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy/check-connection

      * net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy/create-project

      * net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy/posixcube

      * net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy/python-libtest

      * net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy/net.cdaniels.python

    * toolchest-doc now supports directives (eg. "toolchest-doc repo" works as
      expected)

    * moved a number of script from net.cdaniels.toolchest.tools/universal-tools
      to net.cdaniels.toolchest.tools/aliases

    * added the alias gir->git

    * added toolchest-dev package

    * added toolchest-dev/tcdev-makepkg

    * added audioutil/audioutil-2aac

    * patched audioutil-2alac to correctly strip extensions other than .flac

  2017-05-07 - Charles Daniels:

    * toolchest-package.lib will now refuse to install/uninstall a package which
      uses a Makefile for installation/uninstallation if GNU make is not present
      on the system. To this end, packages may now safely assume that GNU make
      will be used for installation/uninstallation

    * net.cdaniels.toolchest.tools/universal-tools is now marked as a dependency
      of net.cdaniels.toolchest.ports/cmatrix, which depends one "extract", but
      was not correctly marked as depending on universal-tools.

    * fixed incorrect presence of trailing newline in dep/ files for several
      packages

  2017-05-19 - Charles Daniels:

    * Added 2mif utility code-tools package.

  2017-05-26 - Charles Daniels:

    * add audioutil-2mp3

  2017-06-28 - Charles Daniels:

    * Add drivecheck package.

  2017-07-11 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed an issue with tcdev-makepkg where dependency list stubs were
      created in the package root, rather than in the dep directory.

  2017-08-06 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed a minor bug where lib/generic-install and lib/toolchest-package.lib
      were not using the toolchest's built-in realpath implementation, which
      caused some functionality to not work correctly on macOS.

    * Implemented the 'realpath' package to expose the toolchest's built-in
      realpath implementation via $PATH.

1.1.1:

  2017-08-28 - Charles Daniels:

    * Deprecate net.cdaniels.toolchest.uofsc - it has been moved to a separate,
      privately-managed repository.

  2017-08-29 - Charles Daniels:

    * Added pdf-scrub script to pdfutils package for repairing damaged
      PDFs, and also for flattening them to simple images.

    * pdfutils now depends on: gs, convert, parallel, mutool, pdftocairo,
      and pdfseparate.

    * Added texutil-mkgnuplot for handling GnuPlot files.

    * Added texutil-cleangp to clean up GnuPlot files.

    * Added texutil-autobuild to handle calling other texutil scripts as
      needed.

    * Formatting improvements on existing texutil code.

  2017-10-09 - Charles Daniels:

    * textil-cleanup now handles .bbl and .blg files correctly.

    * Added a package for latexrun.

  2017-10-14 - Charles Daniels:

    * Rewrote system-statusline in Python for portability.

    * Simpler, less platform-dependant system-lock.

  2017-10-16 - Charles Daniels:

    * texutil-mktex is now backed by latexrun.

    * Implemented the new texbuild LaTeX build utility, which will ultimately
      replace texutil in the long run. texutil will be moved to
      net.cdaniels.toolchest.legacy by 1.2.0.

  2017-10-25 - Charle Daniels:

    * Added tomdoc.sh port.

  2017-10-26 - Charles Daniels:

    * Updated system-statusline for better Linux support.

    * Added port for shellcheck (Linux version only)
