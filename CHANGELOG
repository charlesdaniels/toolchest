    * Fixed an issue affecting FreeBSD11 (and probably other BSD systems)
      where $0/../.. would error because $0 was a file, not a directory.
      This expansion is legal in many sh implementations (including macOS
      10.12), but failed on FreeBSD 11.
      
      This was fixed by removing the `toolchest` from the end of `realpath
      $0` using sed and working relative to that, as the parent of a file
      should always be a directory.

0.0.3-ALPHA:

  2016-11-12 - Charles Daniels:

    * Installer now uses tar in a rather novel way to copy directories while
      preserving symlinks. This fixes an issue where the installer would
      copy links to generic-installer and generic-uninstaller as if they
      were files with the actual contents of the relevant libraries.
      
      This method was chosen instead of cp --preserve=links because BSD-
      style systems (tested: macOS 10.12, FreeBSD 11) do not support this
      syntax for cp.
    
    * Added additional progress messages to installer
    
    * Added random-uuid to universal-tools package

    * Fixed a bug in acquire-toolchest-dirs which caused it to incorrectly
      identify NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR

    * Added check-command-exists library to coreutils libraries

    * universal-tools now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies

    * archiveutils now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies
