0.0.2-ALPHA:

  2016-12-12 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed an issue affecting FreeBSD11 (and probably other BSD systems)
      where $0/../.. would error because $0 was a file, not a directory.
      This expansion is legal in many sh implementations (including macOS
      10.12), but failed on FreeBSD 11.

      This was fixed by removing the `toolchest` from the end of `realpath
      $0` using sed and working relative to that, as the parent of a file
      should always be a directory.

0.0.3-ALPHA:

  2016-12-12 - Charles Daniels:

    * Installer now uses tar in a rather novel way to copy directories while
      preserving symlinks. This fixes an issue where the installer would
      copy links to generic-installer and generic-uninstaller as if they
      were files with the actual contents of the relevant libraries.

      This method was chosen instead of cp --preserve=links because BSD-
      style systems (tested: macOS 10.12, FreeBSD 11) do not support this
      syntax for cp.

    * Added additional progress messages to installer

    * Added random-uuid to universal-tools package

  2016-12-13 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed a bug in acquire-toolchest-dirs which caused it to incorrectly
      identify NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR

    * Added check-command-exists library to coreutils libraries

    * universal-tools now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies

    * archiveutils now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies

  2016-12-16 - Charles Daniels

    * renamed the mac-shortcuts package to macosutils to better reflect purpose

    * renamed cleardns to macosutils-cleardns

    * added an alternate method of DNS cache flushing to macosutils-cleardns

    * macosutils-cleardns no longer kills mDNSResponder as root - this may
      reduce it's effectiveness when running as non-root users

    * renamed unquarintine to macosutils-unquarantine

    * added macosutils-fixwifi script to troubleshoot common end-user network
      problems

  2016-12-16 - Charles Daniels

    * added package to install m-cli

0.0.4-ALPHA:

  2016-12-19 - Charles Daniels:

    * Wrote the carbonite 0.0.1 file format specification

  2016-12-20 - Charles Daniels:

    carbonite:

      - argument parsing

      - logging (via loggingutils)

    * added the net.cdaniels.python package with lib/loggingutils.py package

    * added `dir` directive to `toolchest`

  2016-12-21 - Charles Daniels:

    net.cdaniels.toolchest.coreutils:

      sensible-python3

        * add support for Python 3.6

        * add support for Python 3.7

    carbonite:

      * payload and include validation

      * checksum generation

      * archive generation

      * can produce valid output via --archive_only

      * installer (via Makefile)

      * sh wrapper

      * payload extract-execute script

      * carbonite standalone executable generation

0.0.5-ALPHA

  2016-12-21 - Charles Daniels:

    * implemented function to check if packages are installed, and to mark
      them installed or uninstalled.

      * still need to make the package install/uninstall directives interface
        with the new functions.

      * implemented "toolchest package mark-installed"

      * implemented "toolchest package mark-uninstalled"

  2016-12-22 - Charles Daniels:

    * add iproute2mac package

    * toolchest management utility now correctly interacts with installation
      status. For example, it will refuse to install a package which is
      already installed.

    * implemented "toolchest package list-installed"

    * "toolchest package mark-[un]installed" now refuses to work on
      nonexistent packages

    pdfutils:

      * add support for PDFPen

      * fixed a bug where paths containing spaces would result in invoke-*-ocr
        being called on a garbage path.

      * installer now warns if no supported OCR software is detected

    * toolchest management utility now has internal functions to perform
      unconditional package installations and uninstallations.

    * toolchest now has an "internal" directive for internal use commands

    * implemented internal use commands:

      * internal package unconditional-install

      * internal package unconditional-uninstall

      * internal package mark-installed

      * internal package mark-uninstalled

    * removed package mark-installed and mark-uninstalled, as these were
      intended to be internal use only from the getgo (the same functionality
      is now provided by the internal commands above).

    * implemented `toolchest refresh` to refresh toolchest installation,
      preserving only configuration and installed package listing.

    * toolchest package list-installed now displays an error message when the
      package list has not yet been initialized.

  2016-12-24 - Charles Daniels:

    * added package for tcc c compiler

  2016-12-26 - Charles Daniels:

    * added user's manual

    * added packaging guide

  2016-12-30 - Charles Daniels:

    * added normalize-path implementation in...

      * Python

      * pure SH

      * BASH + readlink

    * added normalize-path to net.cdaniels.coreutils as a binary in $PATH, to
      provide cross-platform path normalization - it should be used to replace
      realpath in all scripts from here out.

  2016-12-31 - Charles Daniels:

    * acquire-toolchest-dirs now backed by `toolchest dir`

    * documented conventions for acquiring toolchest install dir

    * added directives to ``acquire-toolchest-dirs``, implemented...

      * export - produces legacy functionality

      * dironly - identical behaviour to ``toolchest dir``, intended as a
        stable API to provide this functionality for scripts

    * replaced normalize-path with Michael Kropat's sh implementation from
      GitHub. normalize-path is still left as a coreutils binary for
      convienience, but it simply wraps the new lib/realpath.lib

  2017-01-01 - Charles Daniels:

    * added mirror-directory command to coreutils

    * added dependency resolution - see toolchest header for docs

    * T376 now causes ``toolchest`` to exit directly with an exit code of 1

  2017-01-03 - Charles Daniels:

    * toolchest now supports running from anywhere on the system

    * ``toolchest install`` and ``toolchest uninstall`` have been removed -
      see updated user manual for documentation on the new install procedure.

    * removed warning ``T176`` and related checks

    * added ``toolchest setup`` to set up ``local``

    * check_command_exists from check-command-exists.lib no longer declared
      with the function keyword for compatibility with BSD

    * preinstall script for universal-tools now ises . instead of soirce for
      BSD compatibility

  2017-01-07 - Charles Daniels:

    * fixed bug affecting systems with sh being BASH 3.X (and probably others)
      ``realpath`` re-implementation in the management utility was not
      detected correctly, resulting in bogus values for
      $NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR - while ugly, the selected solution was to
      simply move it to the top of the file.

      This issue was found to affect Mac OSX 10.5.8, and may have affected
      other systems with old versions of BASH.

    * added logic to ``toolchest setup`` to symlink normalize-path to
      realpath is realpath is not found on the system

      NOTE: this check does not seem reliable on OSX 10.5.8... further
      investigation is needed.

  2017-01-08 - Charles Daniels:

    * added youtube-dl package

  2017-01-09 - Charles Daniels:

    * added generate-monatomic-strseq to archiveutils

  2017-01-10 - Charles Daniels:

    * fixed a bug affecting Ubuntu Linux where `toolchest package` sould
      sometimes attempt to shift an argument that did not exist.

    * removed a redundant source command from pkg-search

  2017-01-11 - Charles Daniels:

    * removed some dead code from pkg-install

    * fixed system-statusline so it fails more gracefully whe nsome of the
      commands it depends on are not present

    * system-statusline now supports amixer for detecting volume level

  2017-01-14 - Charles Daniels:

    * added package for pamixer (debian does not package pamixer)

    * added package for Linux version of sublime text 3 (Debian does not
      package it either)

    * added support for checking OS uname as a package dependency

  2017-01-15 - Charles Daniels:

    * considerable improvements to burn in universal-utils

      * remove dependency on "wc"

      * remove dependency on "pv", although it is still used if present

      * can now run itself as root by passing "asroot" on $3

  2017-01-16 - Charles Daniels:

    * improved makefile for pamixer - library dependencies are now checked via
      ldconfig

      * possible regression: it is not yet clear whether this approach will be
        portable to *BSD, which can also use pulseaudio in some circumstances.
        This should be tested.

    * systemutils.system-statusline - fixed a bug where MUTE state was not
      detected correctly due to `==` rater than `=` in an if statement.

      * MEMO: it has come to my attention that the correct operator for string
        comparison in POSIX sh is `=`, not `==`.

  2017-01-17 - Charles Daniels:

    * fixed issue where preinstall script for archiveutils used `source`
      instead of `.`

    * remove preinstall script from archiveutils in favor of using toolchest's
      built in dependency resolution.

    * `toolchest setup` now symlinks md5sum to md5 if the former is present in
      $PATH but the latter is not.

  2017-01-19 - Charles Daniels:

    * generic-install now also links files in lib/

    * added zsh-autosuggestions port

  2017-01-20 - Charles Daniels:

    * added port for zsh-syntax-highlighting

  2017-01-24 - Charles Daniels:

    * added port for todo.txt-cli

  2017-01-25 - Charles Daniels:

    * added port for MARS MIPS emulator

    * Updated sort-notes for Spring 2017

  2017-01-29 - Charles Daniels:

    * added the texutil package

  2017-01-30 - Charles Daniels:

    * Added dependencies to sytsemutils as planned in the ROADMAP.

    * Added dependencies to todotxt-extensions, as planned in the ROADMAP.

      * I am not aware of a good way to validate that the system's ``sed`` is
        GNU sed.

    * system-statusline now gracefully degrades when running on kernels
      without procfs, or systems without ``sensors``, etc.

      * Possible new bug: IP address is not detected correctly on Darwin
        systems (using the ``ip`` router from ``iproute2mac``).

    * mirror-directory will now show progress using ``pv``, if ``pv`` is
      present on the system, and if ``$3`` is ``progress``.

    * added a new script, toolchest-doc, which extracts the documentation
      headers from toolchest files.
