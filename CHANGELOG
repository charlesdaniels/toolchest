0.0.2-ALPHA:

  2016-12-12 - Charles Daniels:

    * Fixed an issue affecting FreeBSD11 (and probably other BSD systems)
      where $0/../.. would error because $0 was a file, not a directory.
      This expansion is legal in many sh implementations (including macOS
      10.12), but failed on FreeBSD 11.
      
      This was fixed by removing the `toolchest` from the end of `realpath
      $0` using sed and working relative to that, as the parent of a file
      should always be a directory.

0.0.3-ALPHA:

  2016-12-12 - Charles Daniels:

    * Installer now uses tar in a rather novel way to copy directories while
      preserving symlinks. This fixes an issue where the installer would
      copy links to generic-installer and generic-uninstaller as if they
      were files with the actual contents of the relevant libraries.
      
      This method was chosen instead of cp --preserve=links because BSD-
      style systems (tested: macOS 10.12, FreeBSD 11) do not support this
      syntax for cp.
    
    * Added additional progress messages to installer
    
    * Added random-uuid to universal-tools package
  
  2016-12-13 - Charles Daniels:
  
    * Fixed a bug in acquire-toolchest-dirs which caused it to incorrectly
      identify NET_CDANIELS_TOOLCHEST_DIR

    * Added check-command-exists library to coreutils libraries

    * universal-tools now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies

    * archiveutils now has a preinstall script to validate it's dependencies

  2016-12-16 - Charles Daniels

    * renamed the mac-shortcuts package to macosutils to better reflect purpose

    * renamed cleardns to macosutils-cleardns 

    * added an alternate method of DNS cache flushing to macosutils-cleardns

    * macosutils-cleardns no longer kills mDNSResponder as root - this may
      reduce it's effectiveness when running as non-root users

    * renamed unquarintine to macosutils-unquarantine 

    * added macosutils-fixwifi script to troubleshoot common end-user network
      problems

  2016-12-16 - Charles Daniels 

    * added package to install m-cli

0.0.4-ALPHA:
  
  2016-12-19 - Charles Daniels:

    * Wrote the carbonite 0.0.1 file format specification

  2016-12-20 - Charles Daniels:

    carbonite:

      - argument parsing

      - logging (via loggingutils)

    * added the net.cdaniels.python package with lib/loggingutils.py package

    * added `dir` directive to `toolchest`

  2016-12-21 - Charles Daniels:

    net.cdaniels.toolchest.coreutils:

      sensible-python3

        * add support for Python 3.6

        * add support for Python 3.7

    carbonite:

      * payload and include validation

      * checksum generation

      * archive generation

      * can produce valid output via --archive_only 

      * installer (via Makefile) 

      * sh wrapper

      * payload extract-execute script

      * carbonite standalone executable generation

0.0.5-ALPHA
  
  2016-12-21 - Charles Daniels:

    * implemented function to check if packages are installed, and to mark
      them installed or uninstalled.

      * still need to make the package install/uninstall directives interface
        with the new functions.

      * implemented "toolchest package mark-installed"

      * implemented "toolchest package mark-uninstalled"

  2016-12-22 - Charles Daniels:

    * add iproute2mac package

    * toolchest management utility now correctly interacts with installation
      status. For example, it will refuse to install a package which is
      already installed.

    * implemented "toolchest package list-installed"

    * "toolchest package mark-[un]installed" now refuses to work on
      nonexistent packages

    pdfutils:

      * add support for PDFPen

      * fixed a bug where paths containing spaces would result in invoke-*-ocr
        being called on a garbage path.

      * installer now warns if no supported OCR software is detected

    * toolchest management utility now has internal functions to perform
      unconditional package installations and uninstallations.

    * toolchest now has an "internal" directive for internal use commands

    * implemented internal use commands:

      * internal package unconditional-install

      * internal package unconditional-uninstall

      * internal package mark-installed

      * internal package mark-uninstalled

    * removed package mark-installed and mark-uninstalled, as these were
      intended to be internal use only from the getgo (the same functionality
      is now provided by the internal commands above).

    * implemented `toolchest refresh` to refresh toolchest installation,
      preserving only configuration and installed package listing.

    * toolchest package list-installed now displays an error message when the
      package list has not yet been initialized.
