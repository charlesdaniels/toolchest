    * Script does not respond correctly to providing input files on $@, but 
      does work correctly when "-r" is passed. This may be due to handling of
      spaces in the input file list.

    # 2 - OPEN

    * Script does not update the library root path. For example, converting 
      a playlist which formerly referred to /foo/bar/baz, but now refers to 
      /foo/bar/music would result in the playlist's entries still being given
      relative to /foo/bar/baz.

      To fix this, a check needs to be added to see if the current element 
      is specified by an absolute path, and if so, convert it to a relative 
      path or otherwise update the root component thereof.

    # 3 - CLOSED

    * script seems to produce garbled output from certain lines of input. This 
      is likely due to inputs containing special characters, or characters that
      the shell does not know how to handle. Further investigation is required,
      but it seems like the most sensible course of action would be to simply
      rewrite audioutil-convert-m3u in python, which should handle special
      characters in filenames without issue. 

    * resolved on 2017-02-28
