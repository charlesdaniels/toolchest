    * Script does not respond correctly to providing input files on $@, but 
      does work correctly when "-r" is passed. This may be due to handling of
      spaces in the input file list.

    # 2 - OPEN

    * Script does not update the library root path. For example, converting 
      a playlist which formerly referred to /foo/bar/baz, but now refers to 
      /foo/bar/music would result in the playlist's entries still being given
      relative to /foo/bar/baz.

      To fix this, a check needs to be added to see if the current element 
      is specified by an absolute path, and if so, convert it to a relative 
      path or otherwise update the root component thereof.
