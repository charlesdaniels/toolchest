check-connection:

  * gateway is hardcoded, should be detected from ifconfig (?) 

  * depends on speedtest-cli - maybe silently skip speedtest if not installed?

  * need a tool to bulk analyze output of script (eg. generate speed and
    updtime graphs over time)

pdfutils:

  * need support for additional OCR tools

pkgutils:

  * pkg-housecleaning could use a code review, it hasen't been reviewed in
    over a year

systemutils:

  * DPI_SCRIPT points to a file that no longer exists

  * system-statusline depends on procfs

  * need preinstall script for dependancies

    * ffmpeg

    * xset

    * i3lock

    * xbacklight

todotxt-extensions

  * requires GNU sed or 100% compatible (always an issue on systems with BSD
    sed as the default). Sensible sed should take care of invoking this

  * depends on grep (is this present on all UNIXes out of box?)

toolchest:

  * some kind of unified help or documentation system would probably be a good
    idea.

    * maybe something that can parse out the documentation header from scripts?

  installer:

    * validate that GNU sed is present on the system (sed is already validated)

    * validate that python is installed for generate-separator or move it to a
      package

carbonite:

  * remove limitation where payload filename cannot contain spaces

  * extract-execute.lib does not validate checksums at this time

net.cdaniels.python:

  * should add a python wrapper for temputils
  
  loggingutils:

    * default log path should probably go to /tmp, rather than ./ 

musicutil:

  * tool for exporting music library with various encodings; should be able to
    take a given music library with a particular folder structure, and produce
    a media library with the same folder structure, but re-encoded using the
    desired settings. The tool should use ffmpeg for encoding. 

215util:
  
  * package for CSCE215-TA related utilities

  * script to setup tmux session with whiteboard, script session, and so on

  * script to package up demos, whiteboard, script session, etc. for
    redistribution after lessons are over.

  * script to email out the result of the previous point to enrolled students.
