check-connection:

  * gateway is hardcoded, should be detected from ifconfig (?) 

  * depends on speedtest-cli - maybe silently skip speedtest if not installed?

  * need a tool to bulk analyze output of script (eg. generate speed and
    updtime graphs over time)

pdfutils:

  * need support for additional OCR tools

  * should warn on install if supported OCR software is not present

pkgutils:

  * pkg-housecleaning could use a code review, it hasen't been reviewed in
    over a year

systemutils:

  * DPI_SCRIPT points to a file that no longer exists

  * system-statusline depends on procfs

  * need preinstall script for dependancies

    * ffmpeg

    * xset

    * i3lock

    * xbacklight

todotxt-extensions

  * requires GNU sed or 100% compatible (always an issue on systems with BSD
    sed as the default). Sensible sed should take care of invoking this

  * depends on grep (is this present on all UNIXes out of box?)

toolchest:

  installer:

    * validate that GNU sed is present on the system (sed is already validated)

    * validate that python is installed for generate-separator or move it to a
      package

  packages:

    * Consider the preinstall for universal-tools, maybe make this more
      generic and put it in coreutils lib? There could be two files, maybe
      depends.required and depends.optional, which could be iterated over by
      the generic preinstall script. This could also be used with
      archiveutils.

  coreutils:

    * should move tar method of directory mirroring into coreutils as a bin
      script (http://superuser.com/questions/138587/how-to-copy-symbolic-
      links/138604#138604)

  updater:

    * Add a new command, maybe `toolchest upgrade` or `toolchest refresh`,
      which would backup the existing toolchest install, re-install a fresh
      toolchest, then copy `local/config` over to the new install.

      I would be nice if this could also check what packages were installed,
      and re-install them in the fresh toolchest installation. This would
      require a way of determining if a package is currently installed or not.

      The use case here is that package names occasionally change, and package
      binaries also sometimes change names, which can cause package
      uninstallers to mis stale symlinks to old binaries that have changed
      names.

carbonite:

  * remove limitation where payload filename cannot contain spaces

  * extract-execute.lib does not validate checksums at this time

net.cdaniels.python:

  * should add a python wrapper for temputils
  
  loggingutils:

    * default log path should probably go to /tmp, rather than ./ 

musicutil:

  * tool for exporting music library with various encodings; should be able to
    take a given music library with a particular folder structure, and produce
    a media library with the same folder structure, but re-encoded using the
    desired settings. The tool should use ffmpeg for encoding. 

215util:
  
  * package for CSCE215-TA related utilities

  * script to setup tmux session with whiteboard, script session, and so on

  * script to package up demos, whiteboard, script session, etc. for
    redistribution after lessons are over.

  * script to email out the result of the previous point to enrolled students.
