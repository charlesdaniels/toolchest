check-connection:
  * gateway is hardcoded, should be detected from ifconfig (?) 

  * depends on speedtest-cli - maybe silently skip speedtest if not installed?

  * need a tool to bulk analyze output of script (eg. generate speed and
    updtime graphs over time)

pdfutils:
  * need support for additional OCR tools

  * need preinstall script (sort-notes depends on python)

  * should warn on install if supported OCR software is not present


pkgutils:
  * pkg-housecleaning could use a code review, it hasen't been reviewed in
    over a year

systemutils:
  * DPI_SCRIPT points to a file that no longer exists

  * system-statusline depends on procfs

  * need preinstall script for dependancies

    * ffmpeg

    * xset

    * i3lock

    * xbacklight

todotxt-extensions
  * requires GNU sed or 100% compatible (always an issue on systems with BSD
    sed as the default). Sensible sed should take care of invoking this

  * depends on grep (is this present on all UNIXes out of box?)

toolchest:

  installer:

    * validate that GNU sed is present on the system (sed is already validated)

    * validate that python is installed for generate-separator or move it to a
      package

  packages:

    * Consider the preinstall for universal-tools, maybe make this more
      generic and put it in coreutils lib? There could be two files, maybe
      depends.required and depends.optional, which could be iterated over by
      the generic preinstall script. This could also be used with
      archiveutils.

  coreutils:

    * should move tar method of directory mirroring into coreutils as a bin
      script (http://superuser.com/questions/138587/how-to-copy-symbolic-
      links/138604#138604)
